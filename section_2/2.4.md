# 2.4 The Var Keyword

We saw the short declaration operator and how it can be used within code blocks. What about when we have a variable we want accessed in a wider scope?  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 42 + 7		/* the scope of x is from here down */
	y := "James Bond"	/* the scope of y is from here down */
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	x = 50
	fmt.Println(x)
}
```
I won't be able to access a variable before it is declared. Nor outside of its scope.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 42 + 7
	y := "James Bond"
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	x = 50
	fmt.Println(x)
}

func foo() {
	fmt.Println(x)	/* x is out of scope here */
}

```
We get the error `tmp/sandbox324213631/main.go:17: undefined: x`. Line 17 is trying to acess `x`, and it cannot.  
  
Sometimes, we are going to want a variable scope larger than the code block. If I want scope that is at the package level, I can use `var`. We can ensure our language is correct for the [keywords](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Keywords) by checking out keywords in the Go documentation.  
  
The var keyword allows us to create a variable. Let's add the variable `z` and set its value to `21`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var z = 21

func main() {
	x := 42 + 7
	y := "James Bond"
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	x = 50
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(z) /* z is in scope here as well */
}

func foo() {
	fmt.Println(z)	/* z is in scope anywhere throughout the package */
}
```  
  
Here's a good coding practice tip: Always use the short declaration operator inside code block to declare and assign a value to a variable. And if you need package level scope, use `var`.  
  
Some terminology: curly braces `{}`, parentheses `()`  
  
Recapitulate: To create a variable with a package level scope, we use `var`, the variable name, the equals operator `=`, and the value we wish to assign it, e.g. `var greeting = "Hello there"`
