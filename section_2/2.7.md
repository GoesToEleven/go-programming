# 2.7 The fmt Package  

Let's have a look at the `fmt` package, and how to read the Go standard library package documentation. We'll start with the `fmt` package, and look at format printing, and the different format printing verbs we can use.  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var a int
var b string = "James Bond"
var c bool
var d bool = true

func main() {
	e := 42
	f := "Shaken not stirred"
	g := `Miss Moneypenny says, "Helloooooo, James"`  // backticks allow us to use a string raw literal
	h := `Q says, 
	"I have some new toys for you, James."
	`
	fmt.Println(a)
	fmt.Println(b)
	fmt.Println(c)
	fmt.Println(d)
	fmt.Println(e)
	fmt.Println(b, "says, ", f)
	fmt.Println(g)
	fmt.Println(h)
}
```
[returns](https://play.golang.org/p/3-18hj8XEW):
```
0
James Bond
false
true
42
James Bond says,  Shaken not stirred
Miss Moneypenny says, "Helloooooo, James"
Q says, 
	"I have some new toys for you, James."
	

Program exited.
```  
Let's take a look at using format printing for printing out the type. We can start by viewing the [fmt documentation](http://godoc.org/fmt).

If we click [index](http://godoc.org/fmt#pkg-index) it gives us an index of what we can use the package for:

```
func Errorf(format string, a ...interface{}) error
func Fprint(w io.Writer, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Fprintf(w io.Writer, format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Fprintln(w io.Writer, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Fscan(r io.Reader, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Fscanf(r io.Reader, format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Fscanln(r io.Reader, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Print(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Printf(format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Scan(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Scanf(format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Scanln(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Sprint(a ...interface{}) string
func Sprintf(format string, a ...interface{}) string
func Sprintln(a ...interface{}) string
func Sscan(str string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Sscanf(str string, format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Sscanln(str string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
type Formatter
type GoStringer
type ScanState
type Scanner
type State
type Stringer
```
So far, we have been using [fmt.Println()](http://godoc.org/fmt#Println), there are also [fmt.Printf()](http://godoc.org/fmt#Printf) and [fmt.Print()](http://godoc.org/fmt#Print). `fmt.Println()` gives you a new line, `fmt.Print()` does not. `fmt.Printf()` does _format printing_. Printf formats according to a format specifier (or format _verb_) and writes to standard output. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.  
  
`func Printf(format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)`

`fmt.Printf()` takes a `format` of type `string`. In this case, `format` is just an identifier. It could have been called anything, but it needs to be of type `string` and `...interface{}` (the variatic parameter `...` and empty interface `interface{}`) shows it will take an unlimited number of values of any type.  
  
So, what are the format printing [verbs](http://godoc.org/fmt#hdr-Printing)? "The format 'verbs' are derived from C's but are simpler."  
  
`%v` is useful for showing us the value, whether it's an `int`, `string`, `bool`, etc.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var a int
var b string = "James Bond"
//var c bool
//var d bool = true

func main() {
	//e := 42
	//f := "Shaken not stirred"
	//g := `Miss Moneypenny says, "Helloooooo, James"`  // backticks allow us to use a string raw literal
	//h := `Q says, 
	//"I have some new toys for you, James."
	//`
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%v", b)
}
```
Unlike `fmt.Println`, `fmt.Printf` does not give us a new line. We can add `\n` for a new line. In the [Go language spec documentation](https://golang.org/ref/spec), under Rune Literals](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Rune_literals) there's documentation about the single-character escapes:

```
\a   U+0007 alert or bell
\b   U+0008 backspace
\f   U+000C form feed
\n   U+000A line feed or newline
\r   U+000D carriage return
\t   U+0009 horizontal tab
\v   U+000b vertical tab
\\   U+005c backslash
\'   U+0027 single quote  (valid escape only within rune literals)
\"   U+0022 double quote  (valid escape only within string literals)
```
`\n` and `\t` are two that probably get used the most.  
  
Other than using `%v`, we can also use `%#v` (a Go-syntax representation of the value), `%T` to output the type of the value. Try playing with different escapes and _verbs_ on the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/rWH6skBY0G) 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var a int
var b string = "James Bond"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("%T\t%T", a, b)
}
```
Let's take another look at the `fmt` [index](http://godoc.org/fmt#pkg-index), particularly the [fmt.Sprint()](http://godoc.org/fmt#Sprint) function. `fmt.Sprint()` is a _string_ print. You can see it returns a `string`.  
  
Sprint formats using the default formats for its operands and returns the resulting string.  

```go
func Sprintf(format string, a ...interface{}) string
```

So, let's try it out on the [Go playground](https://play.golang.org/p/PRgiMkPTaB):
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var a int
var b string = "James Bond"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("%T\t%T\n", a, b)
	
	s := fmt.Sprint(a, " something more ", b)
	fmt.Println(s)
	s2 := fmt.Sprintf("%v\t%T\t%T\n", "to pass in", a, b)
	fmt.Println(s2)
}
```
OK, so that's Print, Printf, Println, Sprint, Sprintf, Sprintln. We can see the pattern. There's also Fprint, or _file print_, where we can print to some sort of a writer. We'll learn about that later, where we could do something like Print, Printf, Println, but write about it to something like a response writer in a web app, like write about this in a response writer, and it will send that text as the server's response, because it's writing to a writer, or you could write it to a file. The IO writer is an interface which allows any value, which impliments that interface to be used there, so you could do it with an HTTP response writer or a file. This is polymorphism in action. But we'll get to that later. As well as scanning, which allows you to scan stuff.  
  
That's some pretty interesting stuff from the `fmt` package.
