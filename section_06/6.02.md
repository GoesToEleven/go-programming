# Section 6.2 Loop - Init, Condition, Post

As you're learning Go, a good quick reference is [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/).  
  
For example, here's what it has for [for](https://gobyexample.com/for) 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	i := 1
	for i <= 3 {
		fmt.Println(i)
		i = i + 1
	}

	for j := 7; j <= 9; j++ {
		fmt.Println(j)
	}

	for n := 0; n <= 5; n++ {
		if n%2 == 0 {
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(n)
	}
}
```

**Note**: There is no `while` in Go.  

The way to create a loop is to start with `for`, and the first thing you put in is an init statement, a condition, and a post, e.g.

```go
  for init; condition; post {
  }
```

Let's try a loop with an init statment initializing a variable `i` with the value `0`, the condition that `i` is less than or equal to `100`, and the post of incrementing `i` by `1` (`i++`). Remember, we can always check the Go spec. In this case, [IncDec statements](https://golang.org/ref/spec#IncDec_statements) has information explaining the `++` and `--` operators.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// for init; condition; post {}
	for i := 0; i <= 100; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```
