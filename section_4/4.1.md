# Section 4.1 Bool Type  

It's always good to take a look at the language specification and to become familiar and acquainted with the terminology used to talk about a programming language. That way we can be accurate and precise in understanding the language and in representing it and communicating it to others, so it's very important to understand what the people who designed the language were intending. We will have a closer look at the [Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec) later on.  
  
In this section, we're going to take a look at different types in Go. Let's start[Boolean Types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Boolean_types)  

```
uint8       the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16      the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32      the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64      the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8        the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16       the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32       the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64       the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32     the set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

complex64   the set of all complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128  the set of all complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32
```  

A Boolean is a type that can be either `true` or `false`. If we [look up Boolean](https://www.google.ca/search?q=define%3A+boolean&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA702CA702&oq=define%3A+boolean&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.3231j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), it is defined as "denoting a system of algebraic notation used to represent logical propositions, especially in computing and electronics," or "a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”  
  
So a Boolean is just that; `true` or `false`. It plays an important role in programming. Booleans allow us to have an expression evaluate down to a Boolean condition (`true` or `false`). And then make a decision based on that condition. So, if something is `true` we can do one thing, and if it's false, we can do something else.  
  
Later in this course, we will learn about conditional logic, switch statements, if statements, control flow, and how there is sequential control flow, and iterative control flow where you loop over something.  
  
For now though, let's see this `Boolean` value in action.  

In Go, `bool` is a type, so let's declare a variable `x` of type `bool`
  
```go
var x bool
```
`var` `x` is of _type_ `bool`. `x` _holds values_ of _type_ `bool`. We have declared the variable `x`, but have not assigned a value. That means if we print `x`, it will return its _Zero Value_. The Zero Value of a variable that is of type `bool` is `false`  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var x bool

func main() {
	fmt.Println(x)
}

```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/QuKLHA2JYG)  


Some people find it strange that we don't add a semicolon to the end of lines in Go. The semicolons are added in behind the scenes by the compiler. So, rather than `x = true;`, you just do `x = true`. Go is all about _ease of programming_. Remember, efficient complilation, ease of programming and efficient execution.  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var x bool

func main() {
	fmt.Println(x)
	x = true
	fmt.Println(x)
}
```

We can also do evaluations, or compare things, and get a `bool` in return. If we look at the [operators and delimiters](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators_and_Delimiters), we have some operators which allow us to do comparisons such as double equality `==`, less than or equal to`<=`, greater than or equal to `>=`, or greater than `>` and less than `<`, not equal `!=`, etc.  
  
Let's try some out. Using the short declaration operator, let's assign values to a couple of variables `a :=` 7`, and `b := 42`, then see if they are equal to each other `a == b`.  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var x bool

func main() {
	a := 7 // if we change this to 42, a == b will evaluate to true
	b := 42
	fmt.Println(a == b) // experiment with different operators: <=, >=, !=, >, <
}
```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/XUZP_Hwm_x)  
  
In Go a double equals operator `==` is for equality comparison, and a single equals operator `=` is for assignment.  
  
The language specification for [Boolean Types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Boolean_types) states

_boolean type represents the set of Boolean truth values denoted by the predeclared constants true and false. The predeclared boolean type is bool._
