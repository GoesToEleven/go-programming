# Section 4.3 Numeric Types  

We have talked about [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) and [floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) numbers. What's the difference? Integers do not have decimals. They are also called _whole_ numbers.  
  
Then we have _floating point_ numbers, which are numbers that do have decimals. And these are known as _real_ numbers.  
  
In the [go spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec), there is a section on [Numeric Types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types):

```
uint8       the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16      the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32      the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64      the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8        the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16       the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32       the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64       the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32     the set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

complex64   the set of all complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128  the set of all complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32


uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      same size as uint
uintptr  an unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value
```

Do we have to use all these types? The answer is, "only if you want to."  
  
If you need to specify an exact precision, because you don't want to waste any extra bits in your program, because it's going to be scaling to billions of users, and an extra couple of bits times billions translates to terrabytes of data, then you can be very precise if you know what type of data you're going to store. In that case, you may want to choose the smallest practical data type.  
  
Generally speaking though, the Go programming language was designed for ease of programming. Remember: efficient execution, efficient compilation, and ease of programming. So, you can just use `int` and `float64`  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 42
	y := 42.34534
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", y)
}

```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/OdWUH8uva6)  
  
In this case, the compiler figured out the type for us, and it used types `int` and `float64`  
  
We can specify the type ourselves like so:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var x int
var y float64

func main() {
	x = 42
	y = 42.34534
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", y)
}

```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/0JpmCYezs1)  

Note that here, instead of redeclaring the variables with `:=`, which would create _variable shadowing_, we use the assignment operator `=` instead.  
  
If you try to assign a floating point number to `x` after having declared it as an `int`, the compiler will throw an error.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

var x int
var y float64

func main() {
	x = 42.34534
	y = 42.34534
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", y)
}

```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/onZXyuh-bI)  
  
Looking back at the [Numberic Types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types) documentation, we can see there are `int8` and `uint8`, etc. The `u` stands for _unsigned_. If it _is signed_, it goes from `-` to `+` and the positive is just presumed in the numbering system. If it is unsigned, it goes from `0` up.  
  
If we're using 8 bits, as in `int8` and `uint8`, we can store 256 numbers. That's 8-bits, or 2 to the power of 8. That's 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. So, why does it only go up to `255`? Because it includes `0`. That is, `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` are the first 10 digits.  
  
Likewise with `int8`, we store 256 values from `-128` to `127`, including `0`.  
  
Notice we can store `-128` in an `int8`, but not `-129`
  
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

var x int8 = -129 // try with -128

func main() {
  fmt.Println(x)
  fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
}

```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/YbwTa1YT4i)  
  
Likewise, we can store up to `127`, and not `128`.  
 
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

var x int8 = 128  // try with 127

func main() {
  fmt.Println(x)
  fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
}

```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/BI8wMespZD)  
  
We can be fairly specific as to the level of precision we wish our variables to have. And if we do not want to specify the level of precision, we can just use `int` or `float64`.  
  
The nice thing about `int` is that _there is also a set of predeclared numberic types with implementation-specific sizes_. 

```
uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      same size as uint
uintptr  an unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value
```

So, the nice thing about using `int` or `uint` is that when you compile your program to run on a particular architecture, that the compiler will deterimine whether the int will store 32 bits or 64 bits. A 32-bit machine will process 32 bits. That's called the [word size](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computing)). The _word size_ of a computer refers to how many `0`s and `1`s it can process at once.  
  
## Aliases  
  
All numeric types are distinct, except for `byte` which is an alias for `uint8` and `rune` which is an alias for `int32`. Remember a _byte_ is 8-bits. So instead of using `uint8`, you can also use `byte`.  A `rune` is an alias for `int32`. And that means 32 `0`s and `1`s. A `rune` is a character and Go uses the UTF-8 character encoding scheme.  
  
UTF-8 was created by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike, who also created the Go programming language. It's the world's most popular coding scheme, and it uses 1 to 4 bytes to encode characters, depending upon the character. It can encode all the characters of all the languages throughout the world.  The first part of UTF-8 is ASCII.  
  
Since each character in UTF-8 can be up to 4 bytes, and each byte is 8 bits, you need 32-bits. So a `rune` is a character, and for each character in UTF-8 you need 32 bits, so that's why `rune` is an alias for `int32`.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

var x byte = 127
var y rune = 2147483647

func main() {
  fmt.Println(x)
  fmt.Println(y)
  fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
  fmt.Printf("%T\n", y)
}
```

## The Runtime Package

Let's have a look at the GoDoc [runtime](http://godoc.org/runtime) package. Using this package, we can see the operating system and the architecture that a Go program is running on:
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(runtime.GOOS)
	fmt.Println(runtime.GOARCH)
}

```
You can see something [nacl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaCl_(software)) and `amd64p32`.  The NaCL part is because we're running this on the Go playground. The `amd64p32` is saying that all pointers are 32-bit and the _word size_ is 64 bit.
